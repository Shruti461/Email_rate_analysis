# Analyzing-the-Email-Opening-Rates

Before building an email marketing campaign, it’s important to define your goals so you know if your campaign will be a success. One of the most vital factors to consider is how many people read and engage with your emails. This is a great indicator to show if your efforts and resources are worth the investment.

Your industry can have a big impact on average click and read rates
If you just look at metrics across the board, you can get a good idea of how your emails should be performing:

Your average email open rate should be between 15-25%.
Your average click-through rate should be about 2.5%.
Your average click-to-open rate should be between 20-30%.
These numbers are great starting points, but your expected results may vary depending on your specific industry.

How to measure the average click and read rates for email campaigns
You’ve now seen the percentages you should be aiming for, but what do they really mean? Because not everyone who opens your email will actually read it or click on any of your links, you can use a few simple math formulas to better determine the click and read rates for your emails.

Do the math to determine your click-through and click-to-open rates
To find the average click rates of your emails, you simply divide the number of contacts who clicked on a link in your email by the total number of people who received the message and then multiply by 100.

Your click-to-open rate is very similar. You can find that by dividing the number of contacts who clicked by the total number of people who opened your email and then multiply by 100.

Your email service provider’s (ESP) dashboard should show you both of these metrics on the main reporting page for the specific email campaigns, so you won’t have to manually calculate your performance. However, it’s important to understand where these numbers come from.

Does it really matter?
The end goal of your emails should be for people to click on your CTAs. The higher the engagement in your emails, the greater your ROI will be for your campaigns.

Ways to improve your click and read rates
It’s important to remember that these metrics can always be improved. There are two easy methods you can use to encourage your contacts to open your emails and engage with your campaign.

Start by segmenting your email contacts. If you group your audience into smaller segments, you increase the likelihood that your email message is relevant to your audience. From there, make sure your content is personalized and written specifically for that group.
